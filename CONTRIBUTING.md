# Contributing to Sync-in

We appreciate your contributions and efforts in making this project better.  
Before you contribute, please read the following guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a friendly and inclusive environment.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues & Suggesting Features

#### Bugs

- Check existing issues before opening a new one.
- Include detailed steps, logs, and screenshots when possible.

#### Feature Requests

- Describe the problem the feature solves.
- Provide use cases and, if possible, implementation suggestions.

### Submitting Pull Requests

- Open an issue before submitting any pull request for a new feature or bug fix to avoid duplicate work, ensure alignment with the project’s goals,
  and prevent wasted effort.
- All pull requests must target the main branch, following the GitHub Flow model with continuous deployment.
- Make sure your work fits with the existing architecture, code style, and documentation standards.
- All contributions must comply with the [CLA](CLA.md).
- Contributions are made under the [AGPL-3.0 license](LICENSE), the same license used by the project.

#### Submission Guidelines

- Keep pull requests small and focused; avoid addressing multiple unrelated issues in a single PR.
- Ensure all CI checks pass before submitting (linting, type checking, tests, and build).
- Reference the related issue number in the PR description when applicable.
- Include tests and update documentation as needed when introducing new features.
- The PR author is responsible for resolving merge conflicts.
- Use the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages; pull requests are squashed on merge.

#### Branching

- **Main**: Production branch; all pull requests must target `main`.
- **Feature branches**: Create a dedicated branch per feature or fix and submit a PR to `main`.
